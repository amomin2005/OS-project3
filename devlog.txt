# Date: 12/1/2025 AND Time: 11:48am - Starting the Session
### Thoughts for this sessions: 
#### For today i'm planning on just having basic command line code setup to take in the command line and have it sort everything based off whatever command is sent and also add input error checking so if there are any issues they will be handled straightaway
#### What I plan on doing today: I plan to to be finished with input error checking and finishing up the basic foundation code to take the commands and actions from command line and sort them based on the action and maybe If i have more time I will start implementing the code to create the idx file structure

### Did you encoutner any problems: I did have small errors in this session when I was using sys.argv to read from the command since for input error handling for a while i wasn't able to figure out how to resertict the user from like giving wrong commands and not enough so i used len(sys.argv) to add into the if statement so if the requirement is not met it will just return and tell them to retype proper command
#### Did you accomplish goal for this session: Yes i did accomplish my goal for this session which was running the file and setting input error handling so user doesn't put wrong commands and if they do there is instructions on how to fix and also putting the key and values into their respected variable after they are sent by the insert command and also printing out the command names whenever they are types just for debugging purposes
#### What are you thinking about doing next session: Next session i'm planning on creating the binary file and creating the header with the magic number and the root block id and next block id

# Date: 12/2/2025 AND Time: 12:56pm - Starting the Session
### Thoughts for this sessions: 
#### For today i'm planning on working on creating the idx file with the header indicating the rootblockid, nextblockid, and the rest of the spaces
#### What I plan on doing today: I plan to to be finished with creating the binary file and braindstorm how i will start implementing the inserting into the binary file and search in it, I will work on a basic insert function then later implement split feature for b-tree


# Date: 12/2/2025 AND Time: 7:25pm - Ending the Session
### Did you encoutner any problems: I did have some issues trying to do error checking on the idx file like if the user creates a file and then does the same command to create again then it should say file is already created etc and not create it so just had minor issue with that but fixed it using os.path.exists
#### Did you accomplish goal for this session: Yes i did accomplish my goal for this session which was properly creating the create function to have it create the file with root block id, next block id, and the unused spaces
#### What are you thinking about doing next session: Next session i'm hoping on implementing the insert function that will insert the key and value in the block 1 initially when the root is at block 0 then once the root node is not empty i will switch it so that the root id is 1 and next id is 2 and basically have the keys and values be implemented in the block 1 as long as only 19 keys are sent then will add the split method but that is for later for now I just want to get insert function working and implement print function to debug and check my output etc


# Date: 12/3/2025 AND Time: 2:55pm - Starting the Session
### Thoughts for this sessions: 
#### For today i'm planning on working on the insert feature where after creating the file the user has the option to insert the key and values and it will insert them into the 152 bytes of keys data and 152 bytes of value data and will increase the byte placement by using the keys count value so like how many keys there are so if there are like 1 key then then the posiiton will be multiplied by that etc
#### What I plan on doing today: I will start implementing the inserting into the binary file, I will work on a basic insert function then later implement split feature for b-tree
